<h1>About Me</h1>
I was born in China and moved to United States in 2012. I am a high school student in San Francisco. I like to hang out with my friends and watch dramas. My dream free day will be laying in the bed all day and watching dramas. Currently, I am taking a coding class in ScriptEd; this is a fun experience becasue I can learn several new languages such as HTML, CSS, and Javascript(eventhough I am not vrey good at it but it's fun).
